### Introduction

TaskFlow is a simple, front-end web application that serves as a prototype for a comprehensive task management system. It's built with modern web technologies and provides a responsive, single-page experience for users to manage their tasks effectively.

### Features

  * **Task Management**: Create, edit, and delete tasks. Each task can have a title, description, due date, and priority (High, Medium, Low).
  * **Progress Tracking**: Track the progress of tasks with dedicated subtasks.
  * **Categorization & Tags**: Organize tasks using predefined categories (e.g., 'Work', 'Personal') and custom tags (e.g., `#urgent`).
  * **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize your productivity with charts displaying task completion trends and category breakdowns.
  * **Authentication Flow**: The interface includes mock-up components for user login, signup, and password reset.
  * **Customizable Interface**: A dark/light theme toggle allows for a personalized viewing experience.
  * **Responsive Design**: The application is optimized for use on both desktop and mobile devices.
  * **Drag-and-Drop Sorting**: Easily reorder tasks within your list using intuitive drag-and-drop functionality.
  * **Search and Filter**: Quickly find tasks by searching keywords or filtering by status (completed/pending) or category.

### Technology Stack

TaskFlow is built using the following core technologies:

  * **HTML**: The foundational markup language for the web application's structure.
  * **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and consistent styling.
  * **JavaScript**: Powers all dynamic and interactive functionalities, including task management, UI toggles, and data manipulation.
  * **Third-Party Libraries**:
      * **Font Awesome**: A library of icons used for a clean and professional look.
      * **Google Fonts**: Uses the 'Poppins' font for a modern typographic aesthetic.
      * **Chart.js**: A powerful JavaScript charting library for creating data visualizations on the dashboard.
      * **Day.js**: A lightweight library for handling date and time parsing and formatting.
      * **Sortable.js**: Provides the drag-and-drop functionality for reordering tasks.
